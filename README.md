## Automated framework for evaluating microwave and multi-modality breast images

### Abstract
The growing field of medical microwave imaging has resulted in numerous approaches to image reconstruction.  However, comparison and interpretation of results is challenging.  This is in part due to the variety of metrics used to analyze images, and the different approaches to extracting key quantities from images.  This also complicates comparison of results obtained by different groups, which is of interest given the development of standardized test phantoms.  The lack of a cohesive approach to image evaluation motivated our development of a framework for consistent analysis of microwave images, which is extended in this paper to tackle different types of images.  Specifically, an unsupervised machine learning approach to image segmentation is successfully applied to microwave tomography, radar and ultrasound prior images.  The segmented images are analyzed with a suite of metrics designed to compare sets of imaging results, or images to a known model.   Modifications required to enable analysis of 3D radar images, as well as multi-modality results, are highlighted.  Examples are presented to illustrate the power of this tool for analyzing radar images, and for comparing images created with multiple modalities and algorithms.   This flexible, quantitative tool for image analysis supports translation of microwave imaging to the clinic by providing a clear and consistent approach to evaluating image quality.
